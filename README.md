# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks

## Description
This project presents the use of deep learning and image processing techniques for the segmentation of tumors into various classes. We used the following three approaches for tumor segmentation.
1) The first approach is a hybrid system within which we use Sobel operator which is an Image Processing technique for edge clarification and a modified U-Net which is a Deep Learning Neural Network for training. 
2) The second approach proposes a V-Net model architecture for tumor segmentation.
3) The third approach proposes a W-Net model architecture for tumor segmentation.

BRATS 2018 dataset is used to train the model which consists of 3D MRIs of the brain. The output is a segmented image of a tumor consisting of three regions which are edema, enhancing tumor and non enhancing tumor.
