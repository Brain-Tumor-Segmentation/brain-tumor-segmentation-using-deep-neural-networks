# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks

## Description
This project presents the use of deep learning and image processing techniques for the segmentation of tumors into various classes. We used a hybrid system of UNET which is a deep neural network and Sobel operator which is an image processing technique for segmentation. Also we verified our results using other two approaches - 2D-VNET and WNET architectures for multiclass segmentation. BRATS dataset is used to train the model which consists of 3D MRIs of the brain. The output is a segmented image of a tumor consisting of three regions which are edema, enhancing tumor and non enhancing tumor.
